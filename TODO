TODO : 

1) make grader, and some example programs to test
    - find a semantic error here,
    - also I rememeber need to fix correct line (add +1, or -1 when I make the definition) 
    - and also see a litle bit about flags etc. 
2) read specification again to see if we have missed anything

3) pretify code, specifically symbol.hpp CodeGenEntry is a mess, separate to    different classes 

4) write readme.md

prolems :

func ( var x : integer){...}
var i : integer
func(i + 3) <-- this is a mistake, semantic doesn't catch it




done
